Project is focused on English-to-Hindi language translation using the MarianMT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project involves tokenizing English text, generating translations into Hindi, and decoding the output.


English to Hindi Language Translation using MarianMT
This project demonstrates English to Hindi language translation using the MarianMT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is used for tokenizing English input sentences, generating translations, and decoding the outputs to Hindi.

Key Features:
Uses the TFMarianMTModel for neural machine translation.
Includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization using the Marian tokenizer.
Translates English text into Hindi.
Example included: Translating the sentence "I am learning Coding. How are you?" to "मैं कोडिंग करना सीख रहा हूँ. आप कैसे हैं?"
Technologies Used:
Hugging Face Transformers
TensorFlow
MarianMT Model for Translation
